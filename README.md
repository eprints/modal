Generic Dialog boxes for the EPrints Workflow - The main objective is to be able to fill in data from non-eprint datasets. Typically this data is linked to the eprint dataset via a "dataobjref" field. The modal boxes allow to search the target dataset (for instance: users, funders, projects...) and to fill data in.
